***
## Highlights:
#### - Wireless - No cables or wires need to be connected to the X carriage. 
#### - Intelligence built in - Lock engaged/disengaged status and tool attached/detached status reporting.
#### - Designed for a heated environment - All components are rated for continuous use at 85C or higher.
#### - Reliable - Eliminates common components that can fail (steppers, servos, torque plates, etc)
#### - Convenient - Tools are stored at the front.
#### - True kinematic coupling- Design complies with the maxwell criteria.

***
## Use Cases:
#### Multi-Color	
#### Multi-Material
#### Speed Optimization 
#### Hybrid Process 
###### Additive + Subtractive
